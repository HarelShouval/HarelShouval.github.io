<h1>Chapter 2. The Democratic Classroom </h1>
<p>This should not have happened! Today was the first day of third grade, and Janel was thrilled. In the democratic school that she goes to they let you choose which of the two third grade classrooms you will be in. You can choose if you will be in the classroom on the bottom floor that everyone calls DOWN, or the one on the second floor that everyone calls UP. Janel was very excited about this because she could be in the same class with all the kids she liked, like Olivia, Roger and Mia, but not be in the same class as Madison. Not only was she in the same classroom with her in second grade, but she even had to sit next to her.</p>
      
<p>  Before I tell you more about what happened to Janel on the first day of school, I want to remind you that the fundamental concept I am exploring here is the notion that our social world is composed of frustrated systems. The world's real social systems are highly complex, but I will assume as a metaphor, very simple frustrated systems which can nevertheless generate significant complexity. Hopefully, some of the fundamental properties of these simple systems can be informative. I would like to stress again, I am exploring these systems not because they are a true model of the social world, rather they are a metaphor for some aspects of the social world, and hopefully insights gained from these metaphors will be informative.      </p>

<p>So, let’s get back to Janel, and to her first day of third grade, a day that went so horribly wrong. Olivia lives just across the street from Janel, they are best friends and their parents were friendly. The parents decided that Olivia’s mom would walk both of the kids to school in the morning and that Janel’s dad will pick both of them up at the end of school. It’s hard to remember now, but the morning was a beautiful and exciting. When they walked to school with Olivia’s mom, the two girls chatted excitedly all the way, and then quickly ran into the school as they approached without saying goodbye to Olivia’s mom.</p>

<p>So, let’s get back to Janel, and to her first day of third grade, a day that went so horribly wrong. Olivia lives just across the street from Janel, they are best friends and their parents were friendly. The parents decided that Olivia’s mom would walk both of the kids to school in the morning and that Janel’s dad will pick both of them up at the end of school. It’s hard to remember now, but the morning was a beautiful and exciting. When they walked to school with Olivia’s mom, the two girls chatted excitedly all the way, and then quickly ran into the school as they approached without saying goodbye to Olivia’s mom.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, when Janel’s dad picked the girls up, both girls entered the back seat of his car silently from separate doors and did not talk with each other. When Janel’s dad, asked them, as cheerfully as he could, how was your day, he got back mumbles that probably meant OK, though it was hard to be sure. The ride home was in complete silence. When he parked at home, Olivia left without saying a word and went straight across the street to her house. This was atypical because it was usually hard to keep the girls apart. Only when Janel and her dad entered their house did Janel mumble, “I hate Olivia, she is in the UP class with Roger, and I’m stuck in the DOWN class with Madison again. I don’t know why she did this to me”.</p>
<p>The decisions that Janel and Olivia, and yes also Roger, had to make in choosing their classroom are in some sense similar to the decisions that I had to make regarding SodaStream. When they choose which class to be in, in each classroom there were some kids they liked and others they didn’t. The decisions were not simple, or in other words, they were frustrating. In this chapter I will explore a very simple, that I call the democratic classroom, from it we might learn why Janel’s day went so badly. If we are lucky, we might also be able to generalize from this model to the more fundamental concepts we are playing with. Hopefully, we will learn a little about the process of choosing which sparkling water to drink, and maybe even solve all the problems of the world.</p>

<h2>2.1	 If the choice is ours, why are we still so frustrated?</h2>
<p>To understand what happened between Janel and Olivia on the first day of school, we need to describe the rules governing how students choose a classroom in this democratic school. In this instance, on the first day of the school year 60 kids arrive at school. Since the class limit is 30 kids per class, this group must be split into two different classrooms. To presumably make the kids happier the school introduced a democratic process to let each kid decide which classroom to join. So how would such a process proceed? </p>


<p>Initially half of the students are randomly placed into each one of the two classes. Next, one student is randomly chosen, for example let’s assume Janel is chosen to be the one allowed to change classes if she wants. Janel then looks at the two lists and says: “well Olivia and Roger  are with me in the UP class, and so are 11 more of my friends, but Madison is also in the UP class, on the other hand, the DOWN class has  Mia, Jimi and Sarah, and 13 more of my friends.  I have more friends in the DOWN class, and I can get away from Madison, so I want to switch”. </p>

<p>It might not be an easy decision for Janel because she really wants to be with Olivia, Roger and Olivia and her 11 other friends from the UP class as well, so it’s a little frustrating. She might also be happy to leave the UP class because Madison is there, and she really does not want to be in the same class as Madison. </p>

<p>According to the terminology of the last chapter, when Janel is in a different classroom than Olivia, and since there is a positive bond between them, this is a frustrated bond. Similarly, being in the same classroom as Madison is also a frustrated bond. If she is in a different classroom than Madison, this is not a frustrated bond. In choosing if to change classrooms, Janel used a decision strategy that minimized the number of frustrated bonds.</p>
<p>Janel really hopes though that when she switches classrooms, some of her other friends will switch as well, and maybe some of the kids she does not like in the DOWN class, will decide to move to the UP class, and be with Madison. She is expecting Olivia to follow her to the DOWN class, because they really like to be together. This hope that her own decision will also affect the decision of other students might make sense. For example, Roger currently might have 15 friends in the UP class and 14 friends in the DOWN class, but once Janel moves, he will have only 14 friends in the UP class, and 15 friends in the DOWN class, so when it’s his turn to choose, he will likely also decide to switch to the DOWN class. However, note that by the time he gets to make his next decision, other kids might move between the classrooms, and the calculus might be different.</p>

<p>The main question we are interested in how Janel happiness or frustration levels change during this choice process. Will be happier, or less frustrated, in the classroom she ends up in at the end of this process than she was in her original randomly chosen classroom. We are not only interested in Janel though; we also care about Roger and even about Madison.</p>

<p>To better understand the process, I developed this simple Democratic Classroom game, that you can play. Playing the game can let you experience a similar situation and can also clarify some of the more formal concepts I will use below. When you start playing you will be prompted to enter your first name. Other student names will be chosen automatically. Initially students will be placed randomly into the two classrooms, the DOWN classroom (left) and the UP classroom (right). You will like about half of the other students, these students will have the same color box as you, students you dislike have a different color. Who you like and dislike is assigned randomly. Once you start the playing the game (green start button) one student will be randomly chosen at each time step, and they will be allowed to switch classes or stay in their current classroom. You will see the students names moving between the two classes. Your name will also be chosen at random, and then you will be allowed to make a choice as well. You will be able to shift between the UP and DOWN classrooms, by pressing the UP and DOWN buttons. The better choice, the one which will reduce your frustrations, will be marked in green. Below the classroom panel, you will see a panel with two curves, the blue curve shows how your level of frustration changes as the process evolves, the red curve shows the average frustration level of all the students. </p>

<p><b>The democratic classroom game. Play the a few times. Look at the effect of making good and bad decisions. </b></p>
</div>

<br>
<p>As you can see when playing the game each iteration by a different student makes a choice. A student is randomly chosen from the group, and they can then decide whether to switch or not. This process is repeated until no one wants to change classes anymore. This repetition means that each student is likely to get several chances to choose whether to stay or move. Now, you might worry that this process will never end, and in general this is a possibility, but under some assumptions this process is guaranteed to end (Box 1). </p>

<p>What are these frustration curves though? Your frustration curve (blue) is formed by counting the number of frustrating placements at each iteration. By frustrated placements I mean, the number of students in your own class that you do not like + the number of students in the other class that you do like. The average frustration curve (red) is simply a curve of the average frustration level of all the students, at each iteration.</p>
<p>Note that if you make the preferred choice (green button) your frustration level will never increase due to this choice, but your frustration might increase when other students make their choices. For example, if Madison decides to move into Jannel’s class, Jannel’s frustration will increase. When you make the wrong decision (red button) you will often see your frustration level increase and it will never decrease. If you did not observe this yet, you can play the game again and deliberately make some wrong choices.</p>

<p>Even though you probably already played the game, I didn’t explain yet exactly how the game was constructed1.  Before each game is played, I determined who each student likes and dislikes. I assumed that each kid in class likes about half of the other kids, and dislikes the other half, l also assume that these affections are mutual (symmetric); that is, if I like you, you like me, and if I dislike you, you dislike me. Apart from this constraint, I assume that our liking preferences in terms of who we like, and dislike are assigned randomly. I also assume for simplicity that everyone we like, we like to the same degree, and the same holds for dislike (yes, I know). This process could be summarized in a table which lists which of the students, each of the other students likes, of dislikes. Figure 2.1A shows an example of such a table, for 5 students. To make representation more compact, I could replace the like by the number 1, and dislike by the number, -1. I could also replace the students names by a number. This representation is shown in Figure 2.1B. Such a representation is called a matrix in mathematics. We call this matrix here, the interaction matrix. To make this graphically more appealing we can color code this matrix - like is represented as yellow (like -> 1 -> yellow), and dislike as blue (dislike -> -1 ->blue), as shown in Figure 2.1C. </p>

<p>Initially, half the kids are placed randomly into one classroom, and the other half into the other classroom, this is the initial state. After the initial class placement, one kid is chosen randomly from one of the classrooms and they are allowed to make a choice. The decision rule is simple; the student chooses the classroom where they have a lower frustration level. The frustration level is defined as the number of enemies in the students current class and adding to it the number of friends in the other class, just like those depicted in the game. The student chooses the classroom where this number is lower. All other students always adhere to this decision rule, when your turn to choose you have the option to make the bad decision as well. The outcome of the decision rule is indicated by the red and green colors of the DOWN and UP buttons. You are the only student who is allowed to make the wrong choice.  You should play the game and see how correct and incorrect choices affect your frustration level.</p>

<p>
In figure 2.2 I show an example run of a democratic classroom simulation, similar to the one you just played, but using slightly different graphical representations. In this specific run, all students always made the preferred decisions. Figure 2.2A shows the interaction matrix. In Figure 2.2B I show a different representation of class placements in the initial and final state of the run. If a student is in the DOWN class they are represented by white, and in the UP class by black. Figure 2.2C shows how the class placement evolves over iterations, and Figure 2.2D shows how the average frustration index changes over the same process. The frustration index is simply the average frustration level divided by the number of students.

</figure> 

<p>In Figure 2.2, we see that for this specific example that this choice process indeed ends. The class placements (Figure 2.2C) stop changing after about 300 time-steps. This is also reflected in the frustration index of Figure 2.2D which stops changing at the same time. The class placements do no change even though students are still allowed to change their preferred classroom. Students stop switching classrooms because they can no longer reduce their frustrations by moving. Intuitively one might wonder if this is the case in general or is it possible that this process will never stop. This is actually where intuition might be insufficient. Using mathematical methods, it is possible to prove, for this symmetric case (if I like you then you like me), that the process will end, and we will be able to start the school year. The mathematical proof, while not presented here in detail, is outlined in box 1.</p>

<p>One intuitive simple example to demonstrate that these decisions converge with a symmetric interaction but might not with an asymmetric interaction, is the case of only two students in two classrooms. If both students like each other, they will both end up in the same classroom and none of them would choose to switch, if both dislike each other, they will choose different classrooms. However, in the asymmetric case (I like you, but you do not like me), the class choice process can last forever.</p>

<p>In the following version of the game, you will be able to run exactly the same type of game as above but using the new representation of class placement. This is the same representation used in Figure 2.2. The advantage of this representation is that in one image we can see how the class placements changed throughout the process, whereas in the previous version we only saw the current state of the classrooms.</p>

</div>

<br>

<p>In the game shown in Figure 2.2 average frustration levels are reduced by this process but not eliminated (Fig. 2.2D). Any time you run this game you will see qualitatively similar average results. How is this reduction in average frustration achieved, do the frustration levels of all students decrease? Do some decrease by much, and others by a little? Is it possible that for some students the frustration levels actually increase? How can we assess this? One possible measure is to count for each of the students their individual frustration levels. This mean that for each student we count how many of the students in their own class they do not like and add to that the number of students in the other class that they do like (the number of frustrated bonds). For each student the level of frustration can change during this process. For example, Sarah might initially have 32 frustrating placements (or frustrated bonds), and at the end of the choice process only 25 frustrating placements. On the other hand, Janel might initially have 28 frustrating placements, but at the end have 29 frustrating placements.</p>

<p>We see that while choice reduces the average frustrations, it effects on individual students can differ. To understand more about the process quantitively we generate another type of a summary of frustrations across the whole population. This is done in the following manner. First, we calculate the number of frustrating placements for each student. Then we count how many students have zero frustrating placements, how many have one, and up to how many have 59. The results of the counting and binning process can be plotted in the form the bar plot, as shown in Figure 2.3A. The type of bar plot shown in Figure 2.3A is technically called a histogram. We plot these histograms both at the beginning (blue) and the end of the simulation (brown). </p>

      <figcaption><b>Figure 2.2: The democratic classroom: A.</b>   The change in the frustration index over time. The frustration index is the number of frustrating placements, divided by the number of students, and averaged over all students. It provides a simple single number measuring frustration. (Note this is a different run then the one in figure 2.2.) <b>B.</b> This plot shows the distribution of the number of frustrating placements per student. This type of plot is called a histogram. The way it’s constructed is we go through each of the 60 students, and for each student we count the number of frustrating placements for that student. A frustrating placement is the sum of the number of students in my class I don’t like, plus the number of students in the other class that I do like. For this specific problem this can yield a number between 0 and 59. Then we go through this list of students and count how many students have 0 frustrations, how many have 1 etc. In the histogram, the X axis denotes the number of frustrating placements, and the height of each bar (the Y axis) denotes the number of students with that level of frustration. The blue histogram is for the initial state, and the brown for the final state. The democratic choice process shifted the histogram left, which means that it decreased frustrations in general. There is an overlap between the two distributions though.   </figcaption>
